He can remove one block of a colour at a time, but he can remove multiple blocks of the same colour together. Determine the minimum number of steps in which he can perform this task.

# For example, if you remove [red,red] from (white,red,red,white), the resulting array is [white,white].

# Note- there are only two colour blocks â€“ red and white

# Function description :

# Complete the minMoves function in the provided editor. It contains the following parameters:

# Parameters:

# Name	Type	Description
# N	Integer	No. of Wooden blocks
# Array[ ]	Integer Array	Array of Blocks.
# Input format :

# The first line contains an integer n denoting the number of blocks. Each n line denotes the colour of the wooden block .

# Constraints :
# 1<=n<=700
# 0<=a[i]<=1

# Sample input 1 :

# 4
# red
# white
# white
# red

# Sample Output 2 :

# 2

# Explanation :

# Remove [white,white] first The array will be [red,red] The remaining numbers can  be removed in one strap .

# Sample Input 1:

# 4
# white
# red
# white
# red

# Sample Output 1:

# 3

# Sample Explanation:
# 0
# The steps are [white,red,white,red]->[red,white,red]->[red,red]->[]. Therefore the answer is 3.
